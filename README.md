🧠 Bobs – Your Obsidian-Powered AI Assistant

Bobs is a personal assistant built with Ollama that learns from your Obsidian notes. It fine-tunes itself using your vault’s content and helps you stay organized by suggesting related notes whenever you create a new one — explaining why and how they connect.
